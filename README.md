# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a game for 2 players.  You can play against the computer.  The aim of this project is to have functionality
similar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/.

## UX

Tic Tac Toe is a game for 2 players.  Each player marks a symbol (e.g. X) in one of the nine squares.  Play continues until one player
has three of his/her symbols in a row (diagonally, horizontally or vertically) or when the board is full.
The winner is the first player to have three of his/her symbols in a row (diagonally, horizontally or vertically).  You can play against the computer.

### Getting Started

Choose X or O.  If you choose X, the computer chooses O.  If you choose O, the computer chooses X.  Each player marks the symbol (e.g. X) in one of the nine squares.  Play continues until one player has three of his/her symbols in a row (diagonally, horizontally or vertically) or when the board is full.  The winner is the first player to have three of his/her symbols in a row (diagonally, horizontally or vertically).  If the board is full and no player has three of his/her symbols in a row (diagonally, horizontally or vertically), the game is a draw.  You can reset at any time, even before the outcome of the game.  This is useful in an emergency.

### User Stories

As a user, I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

As a user, my game will reset as soon as it is over so I can play again.

As a user, I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

### Information Architecture

The board is an object.  It has the keys of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.  Its values are '','O' and 'X'. 

## Features
